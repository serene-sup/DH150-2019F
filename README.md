### Overall Evaluation: 
#### Both websites focus on the health and wellbeing of its users. The first site is more all-inclusive and gives information on different types of health while the second site focuses more on mental health, especially for teens and young adults. In terms of aesthetics, both websites use older design looks and appear a bit outdated. Both also had confusing tabs-- the first site in terms of inconsistent navigation bars and the second site in terms of unclear tabs. The second site does a better job of keeping the user updated on the system status while the first site is a bit harder to navigate and less organized. Overall, both websites worked fine and gave proper information; however, there are some confusing aspects of each that could be improved on.


### Heuristics:
**Severity Rating in ( )** 


#### 1: Visibility of System Status
##### Site #1:
###### Not really sure what page you land on when 1st open the app (2) It just feels like an overflow of information and everything is quite cluttered.
###### When you click on an article, it’s unclear as to how you got there or what tab it is from. (2)
##### Site #2:
###### Overall the app does a good job of indicating what is going on and our “location” in the app. One minor thing I noticed was that the home button existence was inconsistent and was not there on all pages of the website. (1)
###### Additionally, the tabs that are on the books at the bottom left corner are difficult to notice. (2)

#### 2: Match between system and the real world
##### Site #1:
###### The “Follow” button looks like another tab but doesn’t do anything when you click it and just shows social media icons when you hover over it, which is a bit misleading and discontinuous when with the rest of the tabs. (1)
###### The left navigation bar seems to have a few similar tabs to the top navigation bar but has a few additional tabs. It’s confusing to see “Conditions” and “Healthy Eating” in both navs but the other tabs differ. Also, the left nav has an additional drop-down menu for the tabs while the top nav doesn’t (there are drop downs for the similar tabs only in the left nav). (3)
##### Site #2:
###### The tabs on the left side of the page are almost unnoticeable-- I did not see them the first time I opened the app. (3)

#### 3: User control and freedom
##### Site #1:
###### If you click on an article by accident, there is no indication of how to go back to the page/tab you were originally (except by using the browser back button). (2) There is, however, a way to exit the “search” overlay page. 
##### Site #2:
###### There is a way to exit and ways to “go back to top” after scrolling.


#### 4: Consistency and standards
##### Site #1:
###### It’s a bit confusing as to what the site means by its “Wellbeing” section/label and whether or not it overlaps with or has a similar meaning to the “Mental Health” or “Digestive Health” or other “___ Heath” sections. (3)
##### Site #2:
###### Under the “Take a Quiz” tab, it is unclear if “My Wellbeing” also encapsulates aspects of the other options in the dropdown menu. (1)

#### 5: Error prevention
##### Site #1:
###### There’s no indication of leaving the page when clicking on the “Privacy” tab. (1)
##### Site #2:
###### There is no indication if we have clicked on a page with no information or if the page is intentionally left black (ex: The “Careers and Employment” page under “Get Help”). (1)

#### 6: Recognition rather than recall
##### Site #1:
###### Options for articles relating to symptoms and health are difficult to navigate and seems to not be organized in any particular order (not by section). (3)
##### Site #2:
###### Other than the “logout” button, there wasn’t much to help the user navigate the website. (2)

#### 7: Flexibility and efficiency of use
##### Site #1&2:
###### I didn’t find any issues concerning flexibility and efficiency of use; however, I don’t believe a site like this requires any unseen accelerators.

#### 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design
##### Site #1:
###### The layout of the articles (especially in the homepage) is cluttered and makes it difficult to browse through without feeling overwhelmed and makes important information less visible. (3)
###### I’m not exactly sure why the layout for the first ~2 displayed articles is different the grid of others. Perhaps to point more attention to those, but overall it looks incohesive and messy. (3)
##### Site #2:
###### The design is unique and creative but somewhat confusing to navigate with tabs that are difficult to see (ex: the left side tabs). There are objects such as sticky-notes, books, and polaroids that stick out the side of the main page with an option to click them and go to a different page, but these objects are easily ignored and assumed to be there simply for aesthetic purposes rather than being clickable. (3)

#### 9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
##### Site #1:
###### If users misspell a word or condition in the “search” bar, there is no way to recover and the articles that show up are completely unrelated to the intentional search. (2)
##### Site #2:
###### There is nothing to help users identify and recover information-less pages. For example, under the “Careers” page, there is no information but the user is not told anything about whether or not the page is still loading or intentionally left blank. (1)


#### 10: Help and documentation
##### Site #1:
###### There is a search bar to help with locating desired information, but perhaps a filter would be helpful as well. (1)
##### Site #2:
###### There’s no “search” or “help” page where users can get assistance in navigating the website. (2)
